# ðŸŽ¯ Root Cause Found: Deployment Protection

## ðŸ”´ The Issue

Your backend is deployed but protected with **Vercel Deployment Protection**, which requires authentication to access. This blocks your frontend from calling the API.

When you visit the backend URL, you get a `401 Unauthorized` instead of the API response.

## âœ… The Fix (ONE STEP)

### Disable Vercel Deployment Protection:

1. Go to: **https://vercel.com/atharvs-projects-bda4da03/backend/settings**
2. Find **"Security"** or **"Deployment Protection"** section
3. **Disable** all protection options
4. **Save**

That's it! Your app will work immediately.

## ðŸ§ª Verify It's Fixed

After disabling protection, run:
```bash
curl https://backend-2ptx354n3-atharvs-projects-bda4da03.vercel.app/health
```

You should see:
```json
{"status":"ok","timestamp":"2025-10-17T..."}
```

If you still see HTML/authentication page, protection is still enabled.

## ðŸš€ After Fixing

1. Backend will respond properly to frontend requests
2. Timetable uploads will process through Gemini API
3. All features (ChatBot, To-Do List, etc.) will work
4. No code changes needed!
